# battleship
Text-based battleship game coded in Python.
The number of tries can be changed using the 'limit' variable.
The target coordinates can be changed using the 'x' and 'y' variables, these are set to be random.
The board is manually written. The code could be improved by allowing the developer to easily change the size of the board using another pair of variables i.e. a grid with m width and n length.
